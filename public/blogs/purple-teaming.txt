# Purple Teaming Sprint
Jan 22 2025 — MITRE ATT&CK • Atomic Red

Mapped business-critical APIs against ATT&CK TTPs and emulated credential access paths with Atomic Red. Built TypeScript harness to snapshot detections before/after each control tweak.

Outcome: bumped lateral movement detection from 42% → 88% without shipping new hardware.
