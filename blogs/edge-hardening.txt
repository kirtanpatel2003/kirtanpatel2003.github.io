# Edge Hardening Checklist
Dec 18 2024 — Nginx • WAF • Terraform

Hardened a public edge by templating WAF rules and mutual TLS into Terraform modules. Added GitHub Actions smoke tests that replay OWASP top 10 payloads before each deploy.

Next rev will include automatic CVE diffing against the AMI manifest.
